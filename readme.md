## Description
This project contains Cypress tests to evaluate the following elements on the https://www.tendable.com website:
1. Confirm accessibility of the top-level menus: Our Story, Our Solution, and Why Tendable.
2. Verify that the "Request a Demo" button is present.
3. Navigate to the "Contact Us" section, choose "Marketing", and complete the formâ€”excluding the Message field. On submission, an error should arise. The test confirms the error message's appearance.

## How to Run the Tests
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tendable-tests.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd tendable-tests
    ```
4. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5. Open Cypress Test Runner:
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

## Strategy
- The test suite is structured to run in Cypress, leveraging its powerful integration testing capabilities.
- Cypress commands and assertions are used to interact with and verify the elements on the page.
- Tests are organized into separate `describe` blocks with `beforeEach` hooks for clarity and better test management.
